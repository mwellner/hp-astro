Recently, I have re-implemented my blog with [Astro](https://astro.build/). They have just released version 2.0 of Astro with some compelling features and since my previous solution (gridsome) has not been updated for years now, I decided to give Astro a chance. I sticked with most of my layout and structure, but had to change image handling.

One challenge was how to integrate a masonry layout for my blog and theater pages. Therefore I needed to find a way to do this with

- [AstroJS](https://astro.build/),
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and
- [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/).

Luckily, this case is [documented on the Bootstrap page on cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/#masonry). They provide an [example on how to integrate it](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/masonry/), which served me as a starting point.

## Base Layout

First step is to install the required dependencies.

```bash
> npm install bootstrap
> npm install masonry-layout
> npm install imagesLoaded
```

You need to include the JS dependencies in your main layout.

```html
---
import bootstrap from "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min?url";
import masonry from "masonry-layout/dist/masonry.pkgd.min?url";
import imagesLoaded from "imagesloaded/imagesloaded.pkgd.min?url";

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/img/favicon.png" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <meta name="generator" content="{Astro.generator}" />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="{bootstrap}"></script>
    <script src="{imagesLoaded}"></script>
    <script src="{masonry}"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Include Masonry

Since I use images on my pages, I also needed to include the [imagesLoaded](https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/) library to update the layout after all images have been loaded. So my way of masonry initialization is bundled in one JavaScript file.

```javascript
var $grid = document.querySelector(".grid");
imagesLoaded($grid, function () {
  new Masonry(".grid", {
    percentPosition: true,
  });
});
```

This file can be included wherever a masonry layout is needed. Just add the following snippet at the end of your page.

```javascript
<script>import "@scripts/masonry.js";</script>
```

This requires a path for `@scripts` to be present in `tsconfig.json`.

## Markup

Finally add the markup as suggested by bootstrap in the blog overview page.

```html
<div class="grid row mt-4">
  { allPosts.map((post) => (
  <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4">
    <BlogPost url="{post.slug}" frontmatter="{post.data}" />
  </div>
  )) }
</div>
```

Since I use `.grid` as hook for masonry, this CSS class is there together with Bootstrap's `.row`. This should do the trick.
